HW11 - Standard

1. The first thing I did was try and implement methods and Node class to create a standard BST

2. The toString method works well, but I think there might have been an easier way to implement all of the different
    traversals and extract common code

3. The thing that supprised me the most was trying to come up with a singular string for all of the traversals. I
    settled on a singular string that gets added to with each method call.

4. The most important thing I learned was finding a good way to print an object using charAt method.

5. Right now, my tree assumes that all given inputs will be an integer, using a value and key for each node would solve
    this problem, but then I wouldn't be implementing the interface without chaging it.
